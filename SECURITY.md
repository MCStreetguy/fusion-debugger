## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities are a serious problem and therefore we do not take them lightly!
We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email security@mcstreetguy.de and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

The maintainer of this project will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
